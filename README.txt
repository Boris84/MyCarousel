MyCarousel 

View in Github Pages. 

I have provided links to the code and live version.

I used Chrome to build this Carousel. Would reccommened using Chrome although i tested it with edge and few others and works fine.

use the white pointers "prev" and "next" on the left and right to srcoll manually.

click the white button on the bottom-Left of the carousel,  wait 3 seconds and the carousel will scroll automatically, click the white button again to pause the carousel.

I made the carousel responsive using MQ. 

Hope you like it ;)
