MyCarousel 

View in Github Pages. 

I have provided links to the code and live version.

I used Chrome to build this Carousel. Would reccommened using Chrome although i tested it with edge and few others and works fine.

Click the white button on the bottom-Left or click on the "prev" and "next" pointers,  wait 3 seconds and the slide/image will change.

The carousel is responsive.
